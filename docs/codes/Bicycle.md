# Bicycle

## Description
 - This LDPC code is based on circulant matrices of difference sets.
 - The difference should satisfy the property that each every difference (modulo N/2) in the set occurs at most once
 - This is a CSS code where each sub-matrix is constructed from the circulant and it's transpose horizontally contatinated. This sub-matrix then has some of it's rows removed while trying to keep the number of checks per column the same.

## Example
Code Tableau:
XX_XX_X
X__XXX_
ZZ_ZZ_Z
Z__ZZZ_
- Number of qubits: N = 7
- Number of encoded bits: k = 3
