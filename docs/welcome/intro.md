# Welcome

Welcome to QECC-Wiki. Here is a **2 minute primer** to the website

## Introduction

QECC-Wiki aims to provide the vivid implementation, examples, and references to a minuscule part of what is included in the original [Error Correction Zoo](https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/).

Visit the `Code` tab to a multitude of empirical and pedagogical codes frequently used in QECC.

We aim to provide not only the description and detailed operations for most of the codes, but also performance benchmarking results between different codes. There will also be playgrounds and QASM codes for implementation on IBM Quiskit and other frameworks.
